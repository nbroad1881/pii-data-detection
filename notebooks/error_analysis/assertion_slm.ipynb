Application     My story centred around the young boy’s love for cricket – a game that is very popular in my  country. To gently nudge the memories of our own school days we used the tag line ‘help  him go back to playing cricket again.’    By bringing in an everyday real-life slice of life, the audience immediately connected with  the story and donated for the cause.

His parents, though of meagre means, dreamed of  giving their only child an education they hadn’t enjoyed - and had enrolled him in Indian School of Business in Kolkata.

It really resonated with me when Amy Martinez said in module 3 that  Mind Mapping tool is created together with all relevant stakeholders to “represent the minds of  customers”.

The feedback we received is that  it also gives more energy to colleagues who have participated in this project.     The biggest challenge was to create support for this new way of working.     At the beginning of the project, we showed a short video of how mind mapping works. This gave us immediate support from  our fellow team members to combine scrum with mind mapping. <START>     <END>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIBN9VJ0S4a    The conclusion is that you definitely can combine scrum and Design thinking.    Approach:    In terms of approach, I wouldn't be much different from what I did in this project. I only see advantages of combining scrum  with mind mapping. As described in the alinia insight, there are only benefits.\n",

As career counselors we are supposed to put our clients back into the  driver’s seat from the very beginning in order not to waste time or talent or both.      2. Selection    In this initial stage of the career coaching process the instrument of choice is storytelling.  Storytelling is not just a design thinking tool (Malak, 2016, Module 2) but also the foundation  of narrative management and communications in a broad variety of contexts (Sammer, 2014,  <START>p.36<END>). Narrative management encompasses personal and corporate storytelling, narrative  knowledge management, leadership communications, and narrative change management  (Erlach & Müller, 2015/2016). ‘Stories or narratives are a unique derivative of systems theory  thinking and are key to constructivist approaches’ (Patton & McMahon, 1999, p.235).  Storytelling is very useful in human resources management in general, e.g. in recruitment  and selection. For instance, if you ask a candidate in a job interview to tell his or her story  </td>\n",

Approach    While the Mind Mapping approach was an effective tool, Storytelling could have been equally  effective for this exercise, given its propensity to “develop deeper empathy in the present, and create  more vivid images about the kind of new future, we're trying to create” (see Week 2, Lecture #1: The  Physics of Innovation by <START>Cristina<END> Abdallah). With such a diverse group of stakeholders involved in  various sequential points in a complex process, empathy for fellow participants as a result of a  clearer picture of each person’s experience could have helped bridge gaps in understanding,  improved the flow of information between parties, and ultimately helped the group achieve  consensus on the most impactful problems before deciding on eventual solutions.\n",
