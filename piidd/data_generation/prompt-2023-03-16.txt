Select one of the design thinking tools presented in the course (listed below) that you are interested in applying to a challenge  of your choice.   
Tools:
Visualization: This tool involves creating visual representations of ideas or concepts to help explore and communicate them. This could include creating sketches, diagrams, or even physical models. Visualization can be especially useful in the early stages of the design thinking process, as it helps to generate and communicate ideas quickly and easily.

Storytelling: Storytelling involves creating a narrative or story that communicates a problem or challenge in a way that is engaging and easy to understand. This can be a powerful tool for getting people invested in a challenge and can help to build empathy and understanding.

Mind Mapping: Mind mapping involves creating a visual representation of ideas or concepts in a non-linear way, often using keywords or phrases to connect related ideas. This tool can be useful for organizing and exploring complex ideas and can help to identify connections and relationships between different elements of a challenge.

Learning Launch: Learning Launch involves testing out new ideas or concepts in a small-scale, low-risk way in order to learn and iterate quickly. This can be a useful tool for exploring potential solutions to a challenge and can help to identify what works and what doesn't before investing significant time or resources.

Challenge: Describe your challenge, including all relevant information.
Selection: In your own words, briefly describe the tool you selected (e.g., what it is and why you selected it for your  challenge -- including any appropriate video lecture references).
Application: Describe how you applied the tool you selected to your challenge (e.g., what you did and how the tool was  applied effectively or ineffectively).
Insight: Describe the insight you gained from applying the tool you selected to your challenge (e.g., how an insight  affected your thinking about the challenge and about design thinking more broadly).
Approach: Describe what you might do differently next time -- applying the same tool you selected or a different one - - and the reason(s) why.
