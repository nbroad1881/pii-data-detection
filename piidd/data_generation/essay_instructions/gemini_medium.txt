Your Task: Crafting a Problem-Solving Story

Think of a time you faced a really tricky problem â€“ maybe at work, in your studies, or even a personal dilemma. In this essay, you'll walk us through how you tackled that challenge using a specific tool or method. Just like a good story, your essay needs all the important details,  and it should lead to a thoughtful ending where you analyze what worked, what didn't, and what you learned.

Let's Build Your Story:

The Scene of the Struggle: Start by giving us a vivid picture of the problem you faced. Was it something in your community? A tough subject at school? What exactly made this situation complex and important to solve?

Picking Your Weapon: Describe the tool or approach you chose to address this challenge. What made you think this would be the best way to handle it?  Did you have other options in mind but decided against them?  Tell us why one stood out in the end.

Game Plan in Action:  Now, show us how you actually put this tool or method to work. What were the steps involved? Did you have to change the tool at all to make it fit your situation? Give us a real-world example of how this tool helped you in tackling the problem.

Victory or Lesson Learned? (Or Maybe Both!):   This is the juicy part! Tell us honestly how well your chosen tool or method resolved the issue.  Be sure to point out both the good and the bad. Were there any surprises along the way?  How big a role did the tool play in reaching a solution? Did it work perfectly, or could it have been better?

Wrapping Up: Wisdom for the Future:  Finish your story by reflecting on everything you learned. Would you use this experience to change how you solve problems in the future? Could you use this same tool, or similar ones, again but do it a little differently?  Do you have any brilliant ideas to make your tool even more helpful?

What Makes a Great Essay:

A clear description of the problem and what made it challenging.
A strong explanation of why you picked your tool or method.
The nitty-gritty details of how you put your plan into action.
An honest look at what worked and what could have been improved.
Wise conclusions about what lessons you can take away.
