# pii-data-detection


This repository contains the code for the kaggle competition: [PII Data Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pii-detection-removal-from-educational-data) in which I placed 9th place out of 2048 teams.


The package can be installed by cloning the repo and running `pip install -e .` when in the directory. Requirements are in `requirements.txt`

The final models were trained using the code in piidd/training/basic/strided_train.py

Inference can be done using piidd/inference/strided_preds.py


Please open an issue if you have any questions.
