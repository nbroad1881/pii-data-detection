Why are SUNITH and NITHIN not labeled as NAME_STUDENT? Mistake or other reason? The numbers next to the names are marked as ID_NUM. It seems like names must be title-cased.

USER QUOTES MEANING CONCLUSION

Person 1 SUNITH 522233062166 Aerospace

WHEN THE WELL IS  DRY,WE WILL KNOW THE  WORTH OF WATER.

When a commodity,  article, or other material  object is plentiful, it is  taken for granted. Until  resource is exhausted

Wasting water when we  have plenty and trying to  save it when its low.

Person 2 NITHIN 843756944804 Aerospace

WATER IS LIFE, TAKE CARE  OF IT

Living organisms depend  absolutely on water, which  means that any right to  one's life or the lives of  other, including other  living things, presupposes  a right to water.

By saving water we can  save life.

MORAL OF THE STORY: Water is one of life's most precious resources.  We all must keep it clean.

Mentions Muhammed Yunus which is a real famous person, and is not considered PII.

Mentions Leroy, then Sullivan Leroy, then Leroy again. Leroy is sometimes B, sometimes I depending on what comes before. 

```
I told them that last year, i was in a village for vacation. I noticed that each  evening, a man named Leroy collected money from  the sellers, traders and farmers of the village.  The amount of the sum collected per person per day  was 1.5 $. Each person could pay his membership  fees daily weekly or monthly. When i discussed with Sullivan Leroy,  he explained me that each six month  he reimburse to each member 90% of his total membership fees and the other 10% is used to face  risks  that could occur in the village. For me, Leroy had create a micro insurance product even he didn’t  call it exactly that. So if Sullivan Leroy can create that kind of product for farmers or sellers, we can do the  same thing with rural population. I also told them the story of Muhammed Yunus who was awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and  microfinance. We looked some videos of what Yunus did.  Because a story with no surprise is sometimes  boring, at the end of my story  I presented them Sullivan Leroy whom I had invited.. All of my colleagues  really appreciated Sullivan Leroy participation to the meeting. He shared his experience with us and was  opened to assist us in this project.  At the end of the meeting, we had the feelings that nothing could stop  us.

The writer creates made-up people "Tina" and "Marcel" which the model thinks are actual PII. Maybe longer context helps here?

The model mistakes "Schlumberger" for a student name. An LLM would know this is a company name.

"Alicia Diane Durand" is an author. An LLM should be able to figure this out given the context.

```
We can unlock the power to

think differently by doodling. Alicia Diane Durand’s Discovery Doodles - The complete

series is a good starting point if you are in search of confidence and want to learn basic visual

elements.

"Ravi" is the name of a business so it isn't PII?

```
During the award ceremony  later in the week I meet with Ravi, professional athlete & seasoned ultra-marathon runner who trains people  to prepare for marathons and Ravi also trains at education centre where school hires his certified trainers  (“Ravi & Co”) service to provide physical fitness training to student in school a part of curriculum.

This is a story about "Bayo" but maybe this is made-up so it isn't considered PII?

```
In my short life, there are many experiences that could qualify as life-changing.  Every new experience was, at one time or another, the first experience. For good  or bad, each instance changed the course that my life has taken. But, the most  transformative experience was the blind boy next door.

Application

Bayo was a blind boy who hated himself just because he was blind. He hated  everyone, except blessing his loving and pretty girlfriend because Blessing was  always there for him. Bayo said that if he could only see the world he would  marry blessing.

"Sara" is a persona, so not PII?

```
To create personas I consider Sara. Sara is 34 years old, a busy working mom with a 2 years old son. She  works full time and has no time for shopping. She does most of her shopping online. She enjoys cooking  and likes the healthy eating style. Since she is busy working mom, a suggested shopping list would be  handy for her, the shopping list would be based on her shopping history.

Mentions storytelling. Is this an indication that the names are made-up? The first prediction for the names is correct, but then the later preds are wrong.

```
Storytelling is the tool I’m considering here to showcase two characters Mr. John and Mr. David,  who as freshmen joining engineering colleges that provide outcome based education and traditional  education. Their journey from first year first semester to their graduation is going to be showcased  to depict their persona towards emerging in to holistic beings that can become employees /  employers.

Very borderline case of a made up story based on a real person. Muhammad is labeled as pii.

```
I started by creating a fictional character based on the students I talked to that  usually eat lunch alone. To support my pitch, I took several pictures of the dining hall and  students sitting alone at tables (with their permission of course). The pitch I wrote was based  on Muhammad, a freshman that has experienced loneliness also during high school, and now has  some difficulties making friends at college. Due to the circumstances, Muhammad eats lunch alone,  listening to music most of the time. However, he is not happy with the current situation, but  struggles to just sit with people he doesn’t know.

## Ideas

- Use LLM to confirm predictions?
  - Is the name "Muhammed Yunus" the name of a student and not a famous person? --> Use Yes/No token probs.
  - Might not need to include the whole essay -- just a 100-200 words before and after.
  - LLM might know about famous people
- Use LLM to make predictions? speed issue?
- Use generic name model to find candidates before passing to another model to confirm/deny?
  - If going for recall, adding all names might be a good first step.
  - Swap out name for generic name?
- Each epoch, swap out the names for completely new ones. Be consistent across the essay.
  - Use a diverse range of names from across cultures.
- whenever a B-NAME_STUDENT is found, automatically check next token
- whenever an I-NAME_STUDENT is found, check the previous token
- Find all words that are title cased and longer than 2 characters, see if they are in name bank (be sure to normalize accents)
  - In the provided set, the following code produces 163888 matches. There are a total of 4992533 tokens in the training set. (3% matches)
- I don't think there should be more than one period in the name. 

- Put instructor names as decoys in generated data
- When training using strided predictions, the model can lose track of the names. The first mention is the most important. Should the dataset filter out later mentions?

```python
  matches = list()

for d in data:
    matches.extend(list(set([x for x in d["tokens"] if x.istitle() and len(x) > 2])))

len(matches) # 163888
```
